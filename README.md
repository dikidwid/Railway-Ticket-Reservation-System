# Railway-Ticket-Reservation-System
This PHP-based train ticket management system primarily focuses on facilitating online ticket reservations and efficient schedule management. It provides comprehensive lists of available schedules categorized by class prices. Additionally, the system offers features for managing trains, routes, and schedule information. The project encompasses two distinct user categories: Admin and Passenger.

From a passenger's perspective, the web application allows effortless checking of available schedules. When booking a schedule, passengers can specify the number of passengers and select their preferred classes. Following this, the system presents a comprehensive booking overview before proceeding to the payment stage. Once the payment process is completed, passengers gain access to their personal ticket information within the booking history section. Here, passengers can review their ticket status, make modifications if necessary, and even generate PDF-format tickets. Moreover, users have the option to provide feedback regarding the system

On the other hand, the admin plays a crucial role in managing the system effectively. They have full control and authority over its operations. When passengers sign up and start using the system, the admin can access and oversee their information.
The first task for the admin is to organize train records. They need to provide important details such as the train's name and its capacity in both the first and second class compartments. Additionally, the admin can manage train routes by specifying the names of the departure and arrival points. Lastly, the admin is responsible for arranging schedules for different time periods. This means setting the departure and arrival times for each schedule. By doing so, the admin ensures that there are available trains for passengers at various times throughout the day.

Lastly, the Online Ticket Booking System Project in PHP MySQL offers a clean and user-friendly dashboard. The interface is designed with simplicity in mind, using pleasing color combinations to enhance the overall user experience. To achieve this, the project utilizes popular UI elements such as Bootstrap, which is a free and open-source CSS framework, along with Vanilla CSS.

The project introduces a new Train Ticket Booking System, which includes separate panels for both the admin and passengers. The admin panel provides access to essential features for managing and monitoring the system effectively. On the other hand, the passenger's panel offers a comprehensive set of features to facilitate their booking process and ensure a seamless experience.
